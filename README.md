# 👋 Hi, I'm Markus

I'm an aspiring AI Engineer currently studying at **Masterschool**.  
I enjoy coding, solving complex problems, and explaining tough concepts in a way even kids can understand.

> 🧠 While some are still amazed by fax machines, I'm building solutions that actually belong to the future.  
> Digital transformation in Germany? Still a construction site. I'm here to help change that – with code and common sense.
